# Why should I care?

You could say, you do not target your products at people with disabilities. But studies shows that 1 in 6 of us expirience significant disability [[1]](#references). Even those of us with perfect health might find some online information hard to access. So, why not make our lives easier?

# Web Content Accessibility Guidelines

## The WWW stardards
Did you hear about W3C? It is a non-profit organization that develops internet standards like HTML or CCS. Their mission is "Making the web work — for everyone." [[2]](#references) To provide developers and designers with a guide to create better websites, they came up with first WCAG in 1999!

## WCAG versions
WCAG 2.0 was a major update in 2008 that introduced the 4 main principles as we know it now. Later in 2018 it was expanded to cover mobile device needs in version 2.1. The lastest update, WCAG 2.2 in 2023, is a base to many directives all around the world. At the moment W3C is working on WCAG 3.0 that is promised to be an easier to understand and more flexible guide.

## POUR principles
WCAG is based on 4 words:

* Perceivable
* Operable
* Understandable
* Robust
  
Each word represents a different principle. All of them feature 87 success criteria with 3 levels: A, AA and AAA.

## Where to find the latest WCAG?
It is best to use [the official W3C website.](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/)
What is nice to know, WCAG is translated to many languages.

## WCAG equivalents/interpretations across the world
Getting familiar with other guides than WCAG is a good way of undertanding the problems better:
* French [RGAA (Référentiel général d’amélioration de l’accessibilité)](https://accessibilite.numerique.gouv.fr/methode/criteres-et-tests/)
* German [BITV (Barrierefreie-Informationstechnik-Verordnung)](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/bitv_2_0/index.html)
* American [Section 508](https://www.section508.gov/manage/laws-and-policies/section-508-law/)

As a designer I feel responsible for making web more accessible. Aside from the legal point of view, I've seen many people struggle interacting with content online. Making their life a bit easier feels like a good purpose for my career.

In the next posts I'm going to share my tips for following WCAG rules, as it is my current learning focus.
